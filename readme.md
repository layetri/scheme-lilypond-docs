### Arguments
- `melody` in note numbers
- `rhythm` in note length numbers (list must be the same length as the number of notes)
### Syntax
`(make-phrase melody rhythm)`


## `make-parallel`

### Description
Combines two or more voices into a parallel structure.
### Arguments
- `phrases` accepts two or more phrases of note number/note length pairs
### Syntax
`(make-parallel phrases)`


## `note-to-number`

### Description
Translates a note name to a note number.
### Arguments
- `note` is an absolute note as a note name (a, b, c etc)
### Syntax
`(note-to-number note)`


## `notes-to-numbers`

### Description
Translates a list of absolute note names to note numbers.
### Arguments
- `notes` is a list of notes
### Syntax
`(notes-to-numbers notes)`


## `transpose-natural`

### Description
Transposes a natural note symbolically.
### Arguments
- `note` is a natural note as a note name
- `steps` is the number of natural notes to transpose by (a + 2 = c)
### Syntax
`(transpose-natural note steps)`


## `transpose-naturals`

### Description
Transposes a list of natural notes symbolically.
### Arguments
- `melody` is a list of natural notes
- `steps` is the amount of natural tones to transpose by
### Syntax
`(make-phrase melody rhythm)`


## `transpose-note`

### Description
Transposes a natural note numerically.
### Arguments
- `note` is a natural note as a note number
- `steps` is the amount of tones to transpose by
### Syntax
`(transpose-note note)`


## `transpose-phrase`

### Description
Transposes a `phrase` from `make-phrase` numerically.
### Arguments
- `phrase` is the output of `make-phrase`
- `steps` is the amount of tones to transpose by
### Syntax
`(make-phrase phrase steps)`


## `scale-note-length`

### Description
Scales the length of a given note by a given factor.
### Arguments
- `note` is a note in the form of (`note` `length`)
- `factor` is the scale factor to be used
### Syntax
`(scale-note-length note factor)`


## `scale-length`

### Description
Scales the lengths of all notes in a given phrase.
### Arguments
- `phrase` is a list of timed notes generated by `make-phrase`
- `factor`is the scale factor to be used
### Syntax
`(scale-length phrase factor)`


## `merge-phrases`

### Description
Merges two or more phrases into a single phrase.
### Arguments
- `phrase` is a list of note/length pairs. Note: this function needs at least two instances of `phrase` to execute
